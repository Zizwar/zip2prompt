Zip 2 Prompt is a powerful tool designed to bridge the gap between complex project structures and AI comprehension. It transforms compressed project files into AI-readable prompts, enabling deep analysis and understanding of multi-file projects by AI models.


## Key Features

- **ZIP to AI-Ready Text**: Convert entire project structures from ZIP files into a single, AI-digestible text format.
- **Selective File Extraction**: Choose specific files or directories for targeted AI analysis.
- **Structure Preservation**: Maintain the project's file hierarchy in the output for context-aware AI processing.
- **Prompt Customization**: Add custom prompts or instructions to guide AI analysis.
- **Multi-Format Support**: Handle various file types commonly found in software projects.

## Why Zip 2 Prompt?

1. **AI Limitation Workaround**: AI models can't directly read ZIP files or navigate complex file structures. Zip 2 Prompt solves this.

2. **Holistic Project Analysis**: Enable AI to understand entire projects, not just isolated files.

3. **Efficient AI Prompting**: Streamline the process of feeding large, structured projects to AI for analysis or code review.

4. **Preserve Context**: Maintain file relationships and project structure, crucial for accurate AI interpretation.

5. **Time-Saving**: Quickly prepare large projects for AI processing without manual file extraction and copying.

## Usage Scenario

Imagine you have a complex web application with multiple JavaScript files, CSS, HTML, and configuration files. To get an AI's insights on the entire project:

1. Compress your project into a ZIP file.
2. Upload it to Zip 2 Prompt.
3. Select relevant files for analysis.
4. Add any specific instructions or questions for the AI.
5. Generate a comprehensive text output.
6. Feed this output to an AI model for holistic project analysis, code review, or architectural insights.
